This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Contact Form — Environment Variables

The `/contact` page submits to `app/api/contact/route.ts`, which uses [Resend](https://resend.com) to deliver emails.

### Local development

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CONTACT_EMAIL=storage@bluegou.com
```

### Vercel deployment

Add the same two variables in **Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables**.

### Verified sender domain

Before going live, verify `bluegou.com` as a sending domain in the Resend dashboard
(`Domains → Add Domain`). Until the domain is verified, Resend will reject the
`from: noreply@bluegou.com` address. While testing, you can use the Resend sandbox
address `onboarding@resend.dev` as a temporary sender.

### Rate limiting upgrade path

The API route uses an in-memory `Map` to enforce a limit of 5 submissions per IP per
15 minutes. This works for single-instance deployments but will reset on every cold
start and will not work correctly across multiple Vercel function instances.

For production, replace the in-memory store with
[Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) or [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv)
and use the `@upstash/ratelimit` package for atomic, distributed rate limiting.
